		<h1>Appendix II: Troubleshooting</h1>
		<p>Below are a series of issues reported by our users for which we have information, fixes, or workarounds. As always, if you run into any issues with Gospel Library for Windows, feel free to send us an email. You can learn more about how to provide helpful feedback in <a href="17.html">Chapter 17: How Do I Give Feedback?</a></p>
		<h2>The "Send Feedback" option isn't working</h2>
		<p>Change your default email application in Windows to an application that handles emails, like Mozilla Thunderbird, Outlook Mail, or Outlook 2016. The majority of users experiencing this issue have had Google Chrome hijack this setting.</p>
		<h2>When I try to select text with my mouse, it highlights it instead</h2>
		<p>There's a very high chance you have accidentally turned on the Live Cursor feature (<img class="inlineimage" src="imgs/mark_livecursor.png">). You can turn this feature off in the Annotate Ribbon. See <a href="13.html">Chapter 4: How Do I Mark Gospel Content?</a> for additional information about this feature.
		<h2>My Surface Pen exhibits odd behaviors when marking content</h2>
		<p>Beginning with the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, Microsoft changed the behavior of the Surface Pen in Windows apps. Unfortunately, this change in behavior broke our pen functionality and we've had to try to write around the change. While selecting text with the pen will still work, until we find a solution, you will need to open the context menu using your finger instead of the pen.</p>
		<h2>Once the app finishes playing a chapter, it gets stuck on that chapter</h2>
		<p>This is a somewhat under-polished feature, rather than a bug. Gospel Library for Windows allows you to navigate wherever you'd like&mdash;following footnotes or inspiration&mdash;without the fear that your listening will be cut off because you've changed what chapter you're looking at. To change the media ribbon to the current chapter, click the "Select Audio" (or "Select Video") button on the left side of the Media ribbon. You can also turn on the Continuous Play feature so that the app will automatically move to the next chapter as it finishes the first.</p>
		<h2>My bookmarks aren't working</h2>
		<p>We know of an issue where bookmarks don't work the very first time the app is opened. While we're working on a fix for this issue, simply closing and restarting the app allows the bookmarks to work as expected. </p>
		<h2>Books won't open</h2>
		<p>There is a very high chance your app has gotten into a bad state from a recent wave of content changes pushed by the Church's content team. While we've added self-healing and protective code to avoid this in the future, the simplest fix is to use the "Reset Application" feature found at Settings > Advanced Settings > Reset Application.</p>
		<h2>All of my menus have vanished</h2>
		<p>Chances are, you've accidentally turned on Immersive Mode. To return to normal, turn immersive mode off using the toggle (<img class="inlineimage" src="imgs/immersivetoggle.png">) beside the minimize button at the top of the app. You can also turn off immersive mode by double clicking or tapping inside the content (on the page where the text is). If you would prefer to avoid this in the future, you can also turn off the immersive mode on double tap feature at Settings > Behavior > Immersive Mode on Double Tap.</p>
		<h2>I'm getting errors when starting the application, like "There was an error prefetching annotations"</h2>
		<p>There is a very high chance your app has gotten into a bad state from a recent wave of content changes pushed by the Church's content team. While we've added self-healing and protective code to avoid this in the future, the simplest fix is to use the "Reset Application" feature found at Settings > Advanced Settings > Reset Application.</p>
		<h2>The app runs very slowly or takes a long time to open</h2>
		<p>There is a very high chance your app has gotten into a bad state from a recent wave of content changes pushed by the Church's content team. While we've added self-healing and protective code to avoid this in the future, the simplest fix is to use the "Reset Application" feature found at Settings > Advanced Settings > Reset Application.</p>
		<h2>Some or all of my annotations aren't visible</h2>
		<p>First, check that you are still signed in by opening Settings > LDS Account. If you are still signed in, check that all of your notebooks are visible in the Visible Notebooks feature in the View ribbon. If all of these notebooks are visible, check that you have notes visible in the "Show/Hide Notes" setting in the View ribbon or at Settings > Appearance > Show Notes. If issues still persist, consider resetting the application at Settings > Advanced Settings > Reset Application or <a href="17.html">contact support directly for additional help in troubleshooting</a>.</p>
		<h2>When I open the hymns or Children's Songbook, I receive a "No Such Table: collection" error</h2>
		<p>An old update to the beta version of the app caused many users to receive a bad source for the PDFs of the sheet music in the app. To fix this error, users of the beta will need to reinstall the app or use the "Reset Application" feature found at Settings > Advanced Settings > Reset Application. If you are not using the beta version of the app and receive this error, please <a href="17.html">contact support</a>.</p>
