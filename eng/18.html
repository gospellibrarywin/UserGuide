	<h1>Chapter 18: Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
	<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-bottom:0em;">1. When will &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; be available in the new app?</p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0em;">Because Gospel Library for Windows is developed entirely by volunteers, we don't give time frames for upcoming or new features. We are, however, conscious of the fact that Gospel Library for Windows lacks some features that are available on Gospel Library for iOS and Gospel Library for Android and are working diligently to close the feature gap between our app and theirs. If you've got a new idea for a feature you'd like to see, feel free to share your idea on <a href="http://ldswin.uservoice.com">our UserVoice page</a>.</p>
	
	<p style="font-weight:bold; margin-bottom:0em;">2. Why did you get rid of the &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; feature?</p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0em;">Chances are, it's not something we're getting rid of, but something that we still need to bring back. Popular features like custom collections, annotations search, and Read Along are planned to make their return soon. We intend to bring as many features from Gospel Library for Windows 8.1 to Gospel Library for Windows 10 as quickly as we can. Only one feature will not be returning to Gospel Library for Windows 10: the Inspirational Messages feature.</p>

	<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 0em;">3. My device has a pen. Why can't I just draw on the screen?</p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0em;"> This is a really cool feature idea, but, at least at present, it doesn't appear to be feasible to implement because of the way text reflows in the application. Doing something as simple as adjusting font size or changing the snap or window size for Gospel Library would cause notes created by a pen to become distorted or out of place. We are, however, working on ideas that will still make the pen a valuable tool for study.</p>

	<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 0em;">4. I think I found a bug! What do I do?</p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0em;">First, make sure you can get it to happen pretty reliably. If you can regularly reproduce the error and give us steps to reproduce it, too, it makes it much, much easier for us to track down the cause of a bug and to find a way to fix it. Once you have steps for reproducing the bug, send us feedback with those steps and some information about the device you're running Gospel Library for Windows on: is it a tablet? A laptop? A desktop? Who makes it? What model is it? And more. More information is always preferable to less. You can learn more about providing useful feedback in <a href="17.html">Chapter 17: How Do I Give Feedback?</a></p>

	<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 0em;">5. Is Gospel Library a universal application? Will the Windows Phone version of Gospel Library be updated?</p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0em;">Gospel Library for Windows is a Universal Windows Platform application. This means that you can install it on all your desktop, laptop, 2-in-1 device, or tablet and it will run well on any of these devices. This technology has also made it possible to make Gospel Library for Windows available to users of devices running Windows 10 Mobile and, currently in beta, the Xbox One. Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 and below are no longer supported.</p>
	
	<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 0em;">6. Have you abandoned the Windows 8.1 version of the app?</p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0em;">Although the legacy Windows 8.1 version of the app will remain available for download for the foreseeable future, we have elected to retire support for the Windows 8.1 application in favor of focusing our limited manpower on the Windows 10 application that runs on Windows 10 laptops, tablets, and desktops, Windows 10 Mobile phones, and the Xbox One. We simply don't have the resources to develop both versions of the app, and Gospel Library for Windows 8.1 relies on an older content source that is no longer supported by the Church's content team. Because Gospel Library for Windows 10 uses the same new content source used by Gospel Library 4 on iOS and Android, we feel our efforts are best spent on it.</p>

	<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 0em;">7. I'd like to volunteer some of my time to help develop Gospel Library for Windows. What can I do to help?</p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0em;">There are many ways you can help! Visit <a target="_blank" href="gospellibrary//content/Volunteer">content/Volunteer</a> and follow the instructions to join the team. We can always use more testers, volunteers to help translate the application into new languages, and, especially, developers with active MSDN subscriptions and a solid knowledge of XAML, C#, and JavaScript to help us improve the application and expand its reach to more of the world.</p>
