		<h1>Chapter 19: How Do I Use Gospel Library on an XBox?</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>

Using the XBox makes it possible to easily use the a large screen television for the family to read scriptures, listed to scriptures, watch videos and study Come Follow Me lessons together.</p>
		<p>The Gospel Library for Windows is an app available at the Microsoft Store and can easily be loaded onto the XBox using the same proceedure for other apps.  A beta version of the app is also available with the latest features, but may contain some bugs.  As with our other beta apps, we encourage the useres to test the new software and give us feedback.</p>
		<h2>The Controller</h2>

			<h2 class="tboxheader">Tip for Finding Home Library</h2>
			<p class="tboxpara">The home library can be returned to from any screen with just two key strokes.  Just press the menu key followed by the A key (the default menu selection is Library).</p>
		</div>
		<h2>XBox Navigation</h2>
		<p>The XBox supports navigation using many of the options but the user interface no longer includes the mouse, touch screen or keyboard.  This section will demonstrate how to easily navigate using the XBox controller</p>
		<p>The first step of navigation is to return to the home screen containing the highest level access to the library.  This can be easily done from anywhere in the program by pressing the menu key followed by the A key.  This will bring up the screen shown below.</p>

		</a>
		<p>The arrow keys are then used to highlight the desired section of the library.  The A key is used to select a section.  Any entry in the library can be accessed by drilling in using only the arrow keys and the A key.  The B key may be used to move back up into the previously selected section.</p>
		<h2>Media Control and Display</h2>
		<p>Much of the Gospel Library content has video and/or audio to support it.  In some cases the support is a link and can be accessed by simply moving the cursor to the link and the pressing the A button.  Other content is accessed through the media bar.  The shortcut for toggling the media bar on and off is pressing the lower right control used for scrolling.  The media bar is displayed below the content as shown in this illustration.</p>
