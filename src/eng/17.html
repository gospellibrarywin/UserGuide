		<p>Quality user feedback is essential to our improving Gospel Library for Windows. Below are three ways you can provide feedback for the app.</p>
		<h2>Feature Requests</h2>
		<p>
			<a href="https://ldswin.uservoice.com/">Our UserVoice page</a> is the best place for you to share your feature suggestions. UserVoice allows us to compile a large list of feature requests and gives you, as a user of the application, the ability to vote for your favorite feature ideas. Before you submit a new feature idea, be sure to search for it using the search bar on the UserVoice page. Duplicates and near-duplicates will be declined. If a feature similar to your idea already exists on UserVoice, vote for it and contribute your additional ideas in a comment.

			<div class="tbox">
				<h2 class="tboxheader">Tip</h2>
		<p class="tboxpara">Although we appreciate the enthusiastic requests for new gospel content, the developers of Gospel Library for Windows don't have control over what content is available in the application. UserVoice feature requests suggesting the addition of new content will be declined.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Bug Reports</h2>
		<p>If you believe you have found a bug, ensure you can get it to happen more than once. If there are specific things you do that cause the bug to happen, be sure to include those with your bug report as they will help us to reproduce the bug on our devices so that we can track it down and fix it. Once you have steps for reproducing the bug, send us feedback with those steps and some information about the device you're running Gospel Library for Windows on: is it a tablet? A laptop? A desktop? Who makes it? What model is it? And more. More information is always preferable to less.</p>
		<p>Once you have a basic bug report ready, send it to us via our <a href="mailto:GospelLibrary-Win@ChurchofJesusChrist.org">email address</a>. One or more developers may contact you for additional information.</p>

		<h2>Getting Help Using App Features</h2>
		<p>In addition to this help guide, there are many users willing and able to help you use features in Gospel Library for Windows to their fullest at the <a href="http://tech.lds.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=141&sid=dfa3c4f5fe4a11e5de86e5ccf5f914f7#">LDS Tech Forums</a>. While the forums are the fastest way to get help with your issues, you can also contact the developers at our <a href="mailto:GospelLibrary-Win@ChurchofJesusChrist.org">email address</a>.</p>
