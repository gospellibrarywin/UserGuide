		<h2>What are Journal Entries?</h2>

		<p>
			Journal entries are like special study notes that help you to collect your spiritual thoughts and impressions, no matter what you're studying. You can create a new journal entry wherever and whenever because a journal entry exists on its own, without the need to be anchored to anything else in Gospel Library.</span>

			<div class="nbox">
				<h2 class="tboxheader">Note</h2>
		<p class="tboxpara">The journal entry feature is intended as a study tool for recording thoughts related to your gospel studies, not for personal journaling.</p>
		</div>

		<h2>Creating a New Journal Entry</h2>
		<p> You can create a new journal entry by using the New Journal Entry button (<img class="inlineimage" src="imgs/journalentry.png">) on the Annotate ribbon or by using the + New button in the Journal Entries tab of the Annotations page.</p>

		<p>
			Like a note, a journal entry has a title and content. You can also add tags <span class="NotYetImplemented">and links </span>to your journal entries and include your journal entries in as many notebooks as you would like.c

			<h2>Reviewing Journal Entries</h2>
		<p>Like with all annotations, you can see a list of your journal entries in the Annotations pane. Simply open the Annotations page and select the Journals Entries tab.</p>

		<div class="tbox">
			<h2 class="tboxheader">Tip</h2>
			<p class="tboxpara">Because journal entries have their own home in the Annotations page (<img src="imgs/annotations.png" class="inlineimage">), they can be a helpful tool for creating lessons and writing talks.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Editing and Deleting Journal Entries</h2>
		<p>In the Annotations pane, you can edit, delete, and share your journal entries.</p>
		<h2>Managing Journal Entries</h2>
		<p>Journal Entriess can be managed using by selecting the 'Notes' button on the navigation bar and then choosing the 'Journal Entries' tab. </p>
		<img class="disp" src="imgs/annotationspagejournal.png" alt="The Journal Entries tab of the annotations page." />
		<p>The number of entries is shown in parenthesis to the right of the 'search' box.  The functions of the five controls are listed in the table below.</p>
		<table class="disp">
			<tr class="light">
				<td>Filter</td>
				<td>The highlights are listed by either the color used or the book they came from.  The desired color or book is selected from a pull-down menu.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="dark">
				<td>Sort by</td>
				<td>The highlights may be sorted by 'newest to oldest' or 'oldest to newest'</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="light">
				<td>Search</td>
				<td>Allows the entry of a search string.  Press the 'search' icon to begin the search.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="dark">
				<td>Details</td>
				<td>Lists the number of both synced and unsynced annotations by each annotation type.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="light">
				<td>Sync</td>
				<td>Synchronizes the local annotations with the annotations stored on the network.</td>
			</tr>
