		<h1>Chapter 15: How Do I Play and Download Audio and Video Media?</h1>
		<p>Much of the Gospel Library content has video and/or audio media content available.  This media content can be either played on Gospel Library or downloaded (to be played later on Gospel Library or another Windows app).  Downloaded media can be played later without a reliable internet connection.</p>
		<p>
			This chapter will explain (1) how to play audio media, (2) how to play video media, (3) how to download audio and video media and (4) how to manage downloaded media.

		<h1>Downloading Media Content</h1>
		<p>Downloading media makes the media content accessible by Gospel Library when there is no internet available for playback.  It can be also helpful when the internet bandwidth is limited or expensive.  A downloaded media file is in a standard format that can be played by other Windows programs.  It is recommended to download any file that is going to be used in a lesson or other presentation.</p>
		<p>To download a media item, navigate to the desired <i> content item</i> and open the media screen.  There are two ways to open the media screen.  (1) Click the Video/Download Button on the Content Item screen as shown below.(2) Click the Media tab at the top of the screen.</p>
		<img class="disp WillChange" src="imgs/mediabuttons.png" alt="The Media buttons" />
		<p>From the Media Screen, click the Download button.</p>
		<img class="disp WillChange" src="imgs/downloadmedia.png" alt="The Download Media" />
		<p>Select the item to download and click on the desired format: voice selection for audio files and resolution for video files.  If there are no options presented under the picture, there are no media files attached to the selection. </p>

		<p>Select the item to download and click on the desired format: voice selection for audio files and resolution for video files.  The SaveAs screen will open. You can then navigate and store the file to any desired location on the computer.</p>
		<img class="disp WillChange" src="imgs/storevideo.png" alt="The Store Video Pane" />
		<p>Press the Save button to complete the download.</p>
		<h1>Playing and Deleting Downloaded Media Files</h1>
		<p>Once a file has been downloaded, it can be played directly from the computer using the GLW program.  The Downloaded Media screen directly supports playback of the downloaded files.  This screen contains all of the media currently downloaded in GLW.</p>
		<p>To open the Downloaded Media screen press the Media tab.   It will either take you to the Media screen or the Downloaded Media screen.  If the Media screen opens, press the Manage Media button and the Downloaded Media screen will open.</p>
		<img class="disp WillChange" src="imgs/managerpane.png" alt="The Media Manager Pane" />
		<p>On the Downloaded Media screen, each media file has an associated picture and under the pictures are buttons to play or delete the file.</p>
		<p>Audio files contain an audio symbol (<img src="imgs/speaker.png" class="inlineimage">). It is not a button.  Video files do not contain the audio symbol.</p>
		<p>The controls on the top of the pane are described as follows:</p>
		<p>There are 2 playback methods.</p>
		<ol type="1">
			<li>The one-step method is to push the Play button (<img src="imgs/playbutton.png" class="inlineimage">).  At the conclusion, press the Close Player button (which appeared when you started the player).</li>
			<li>Window Screen (<img src="imgs/playnewwindow.png" class="inlineimage">) opens the player in a new window, which allows you to continue using the original GLW window simultaneously with the media player.  (See Chapter 6: How Do I Use Tabs and Windows?)</li>
		</ol>
		<p>There are two additional buttons attached to each downloaded file.</p>
		<ol type="1">
			<li>Source Page (<img src="imgs/sheet.png" class="inlineimage">)  opens the page from which the media was originally downloaded. Although the media can be played from the source page, it may played from the internet instead of from the downloaded file.</li>
			<li>The Delete button (<img src="imgs/trashcan.png" class="inlineimage">) removes the file from the computer.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The buttons in the top left corner allow  you to manage the appearance of the Downloaded Media screen.</p>
		<table class="disp">
			<tr class="dark">
				<td>Switch View</td>
				<td>Switches between views with the pictures and views without pictures..</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="light">
				<td>Sort by Most Recent</td>
				<td>Sorts with the latest download first (default sort).</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="dark">
				<td>Sort by Name</td>
				<td>Sorts downloads alphabetically A-Z..</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="light">
				<td>Close player</td>
				<td>Closes the media player.  The control shows only after the player is opened.</td>
			</tr>

				<td>Filter Box (defalult value ALL)</td>
